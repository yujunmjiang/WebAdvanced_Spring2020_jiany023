## Final Project
Base on the [previous project](https://github.com/yujunmjiang/WebAdvanced_Spring2020_jiany023/tree/master/week8_hw) about the re-design of the NYPD's [CompStat 2.0](https://compstat.nypdonline.org/2e5c3f4b-85c1-4635-83c6-22b27fe7c75c/view/89) virtual portal, I have re-constructed the whole website with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and connected it to other APIs. In this version, I can move my code from the server side into a browser. Vue.js is an approachable JavaScript framework which can provide maintainable and testable code base.

In this updated version, I used a new JavaScript library called [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) to visualize all the data points. The [Vue-ECharts](https://github.com/ecomfe/vue-echarts/blob/master/README.md) repository depends on Vue.js v2.2.6 +, and it can be installed by command `$ npm install echarts vue-echarts` or content delivery network (CDN). The application with responsive grid system built by [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is shown in below.
