## Week 02 Assignment

#### Problem
1. Create a flow diagram on a decision-based activity.
2. Create a small quiz or text adventure (example is available on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jannypie/pen/DcHdo)).

#### Solution
I created a quiz website to test people's common sense on art history. Each multiple choice only has one correct answer and people will know the result immediately base on the background color change.
