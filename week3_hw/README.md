#### Task
1. Design the way you want your website to look (Sketch, Illustrator, Hand Drawing...)
2. Create the structure (HTML / CSS) for your final project. Make sure that itâ€™s responsive.

#### Solution

The interface has three functions which are return to the default location, access to your current location, and report a real time shooting incident (add new data point to the existing dataset).
